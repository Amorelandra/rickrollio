__rickroll your friends (or strangers) with twilio!__

_a little package for the quick hack I wrote to troll everyone that gave me their number @ nodeconf 2012. have fun!_

	Step 1) Open config.json.example, save it as config.json
	Step 2) Add your accountSid, authToken, applicationSid, & play URL (audio file)
	Step 3) Enter the phone numbers to be dialed (and your number)
	Step 4) ????
	Step 5) Profit. (run `node rickroll`)

#### NOTE: numbers must be formatted properly. e.g. "+18008675309"

You should see console.log output for the call durations once everyone has completed their roll (or rejected the call). You can now run statistics on the effectiveness of your trolling. ;3
